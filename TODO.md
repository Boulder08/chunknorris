# Short term development goals
- Improve the ffmpeg scene change detection method, or implement a new one
- Add a semi-automatic method for applying a film grain table based on the original source
- Add a possibility to create a simple encoding script that just loads the source, maybe crop + downscale as well.
  
# Long term development goals
- Support other encoders like x265
- Clean the script :D
