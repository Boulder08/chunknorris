# Short term development goals
- Add a possibility to create a simple encoding script that just loads the source, maybe crop + downscale as well
- Move presets, folder setup to a separate .ini file to allow easier updating and customization of the script
  
# Long term development goals
- Implement a simple GUI
- Support other encoders like x265
- Clean the script :D
